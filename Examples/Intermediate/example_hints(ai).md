# AI Debugging Hints: Intermediate Example 1

### Goal

* **Objective**: Determine if a list contains any duplicate values by comparing elements.
* **Concepts**: Using nested loops, list indexing (`nums[i]`), and conditional logic (`if`).

### Triage

This section lists potential areas where bugs might occur in this type of problem. Check if your code might have one of these issues.

* **Possible Bug**: The nested loops are not structured correctly to compare every unique pair of elements.
* **Possible Bug**: The logic in the `if` statement is flawed because it's not correctly identifying what makes an element a "duplicate."
* **Possible Bug**: The function is returning `True` or `False` prematurely without checking all necessary conditions.

### Guided Checks

Follow these steps to diagnose the issue in your code.

1.  **Trace the Indices**: Add `print(f"Comparing index i={i} with index j={j}")` as the first line inside your inner `for` loop.
2.  **Inspect the Values**: Below that, add `print(f"  - Comparing value {nums[i]} with {nums[j]}")`.
3.  **Analyze the First Step**: Run the code and look only at the very first line of your printed output. What are the values of `i` and `j`? A duplicate means finding the same value at **two different indices**. Is your current code checking if the indices are different?
